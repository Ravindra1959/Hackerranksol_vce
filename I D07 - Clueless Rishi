Rishi has developed a new way of representing decimal numbers in binary notation as he was bored of the tradition binary format.

He uses the following algorithm :

Each digit is represented with number of '1's (ones) equal to the value of that digit (zero '1's for digit 0).
Digits are written one by one in the order corresponding to the number and separated by a single '0' digit.
Rishi learned how to encode the numbers, but he has no clue how to decode them.

Write a program that decodes the numbers for him.

Input Format

Input contains one string - S, denoting the number in the new binary format.

Constraints

1 <= s.length <= 100

Output Format

Print the decoded number.

Code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char str[100];
    scanf("%s",str);
    int i=0, count=0;
    while(str[i])//str[i]!='\0'
    {
        if(str[i] == '1')
            count++;
        else
        {
            printf("%d",count);
            count = 0;
        }
        i++;
    }
    printf("%d",count);
}
