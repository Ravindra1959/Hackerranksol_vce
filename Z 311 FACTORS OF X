One day a teacher gave an assignment to the student to find the factors of a number. The student is not intrested to do the given task and he was searching for the shortcuts. So, please help him by writing a program

Input Format

First line contains an integer T denoting the no.of testcases.

The next T lines contains integers whose factors we have to determine

Constraints

1<=T<=10000

1<=N<=1000000

Output Format

Factors of number seperated by a space in the new line

Sample Input 0

2
4
5
Sample Output 0

1 2 4
1 5

Code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */   
    int testCases;
    scanf("%d",&testCases);
    while(testCases--)
    {
        int var,i;
        scanf("%d",&var);
        for(i=1;i<=var;i++)
            if(var % i == 0)
                printf("%d ",i);
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
