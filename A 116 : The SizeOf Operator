C has an operator named sizeof that returns the number of bytes of memory that its argument holds.

For example, sizeof(int) will return 4 while sizeof(long long int) will return 8. You can also pass a variable as an argument.

So, int var; sizeof(var) will also return 4 as var is an integer that occupies 4 bytes.

For this task print the sizes of int,float,long long int, double and char in increasing order.

NOTE : You can check the custom input option to check your output

Code:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("%ld ",sizeof(char));
    printf("%ld ",sizeof(int));
    printf("%ld ",sizeof(float));
    printf("%ld ",sizeof(long long));
    printf("%ld",sizeof(double));
    
    //printf("%ld %ld %ld %ld %ld",sizeof(char),sizeof(int),sizeof(float),sizeof(long long),sizeof(double))
	return 0;
}
